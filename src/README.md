# Exercise 5 â€“ Modeling with WebGL
* Important Note since we wanted to add the sun and to make a better view of the scene, we change the camera location to (0,0,120) instead of (0,0,5)
* We added the sun as an additional planet and it is placed in the origin.
* To both the sun and the planet we added textures (base on recitation 10).
* Another wing was added to the spaceship in order to make it look more symmetrically. (so 4 wings in total)
* We added an additional animation (toggle on with '4' keyboard key) which make our planet (Earth) rotate around iteself and around the sun.
 and also the sun rotate around itself.
